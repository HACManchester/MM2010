Script for downloading all current UK railway station pages from the English
version of Wikipedia, whilst obeying (and caching) robots.txt and observing
a limit of one request every three seconds.

All of the packages required by this script should be installed by default
if you have a standard copy of Perl 5 with libwww-perl. The only exception
is HTML::SimpleLinkExtor which will need to be installed manually via CPAN.

You may need to modify the path to Perl if you are running this script under
Windows or FreeBSD.

For details of any of the module function calls, see http://search.cpan.org
for full documentation.
