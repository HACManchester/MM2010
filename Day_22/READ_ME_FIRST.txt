I have included a compiled version of the program (MP3name.exe) for the benefit
of people who don't own a copy of Visual Basic.

This program is provided for the dubious benefit of the world, and is released
under the GNU General Public License version 3.0.

The downside to this disturbing show of generosity is that I do not make any
guarantees about the safety or aptness of this program for any purpose or under
any circumstances. If it doesn't work - if it formats your hard-drive - if it
gives you whiplash - if it triggers a recession in  your country's economy - if
it causes a rift in the space-time continuum, allowing robot assassins from the
future to materialise and wipe out mankind's last hope for salvation - It isn't
my fault! I hereby absolve myself of the responsibility of any consequences of
anyone using this program. So there. Don't do it.
