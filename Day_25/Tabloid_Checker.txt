You know how it is, you've followed a link to an interesting sounding article, but when the page
loads, you realise it's on the website of The Daily Mail, or The Sun - two British tabloids which
are not renowned for their journalistic accuracy, so you don't know whether or not to believe
what you're reading.

This has happened to me quite a few times, so I've created this bookmarklet to help find the truth!

Create a new bookmark on your links bar with a title like "Tabloid Check" or something.
In the "Location" or "URL" box, copy and paste this...

javascript:(function(){L=location.href;X=L.substring((L.lastIndexOf(%22/%22))+1,L.indexOf(%22.htm%22));X=X.replace(/breaking-news-/i,%22%22);X=X.replace(/-/g,%22+%22);X=X.replace(/_/g,%22+%22);window.location=%22http://www.google.com/search?q=%22+X;})()



Now, when you're looking at a news story on the website of The Sun (http://www.thesun.co.uk), or
The Daily Mail (http://www.dailymail.co.uk/), if you click on the bookmark you created, it will
do a Google search using the keywords from the newspaper article, so you can discover the real
story!

This also works for many other websites, as well as the two mentioned.
