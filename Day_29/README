Script for creating a sitemap.xml file from a given web site.

Usage: ./xml-sitemap.pl 'http://www.example.org/'

N.B. You should quote the URL which you wish to create a sitemap for to
prevent your shell from treating characters as shell commands.

All of the packages required by this script should be installed by default
if you have a standard copy of Perl 5 with libwww-perl. The only exceptions
are HTML::SimpleLinkExtor which will need to be installed manually via CPAN,
and DateTime which can usually be found in your package manager.

You may need to modify the path to Perl if you are running this script under
Windows or FreeBSD.

For details of any of the module function calls, see http://search.cpan.org
for full documentation.
