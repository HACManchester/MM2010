this program takes an input number, and draws the graph of mX. This is a VERY basic implementation, and could probably do with a lot more work, but i works. Only thing to note, if you want to put in big numbers (i.e. anything above 9) you need to remember your ASCII Decimals, as the language only understands ASCII.

To run, first you need to install a BF compiler. in Ubuntu this is
# sudo apt-get install bf

to run, just type
# bf graph-mX.b

One version of the program has (limited) comments on, and is a bit more readable, the other one is just STRAIGHT BF code. Enjoy!
