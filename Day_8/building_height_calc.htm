I don't know. I come back from a weekend away (see day 5) and nobody has
taken day 8 yet, so I've hastily written this script in about 10 minutes!

It uses one of the SUVAT equations to calculate the height of a building.

s = (u * t) + (0.5 * a * t^2)

Where s=distance, u=initial velocity (zero), a=acceleration (9.80665), t=time

<form name="dave" action="#">
Time to hit ground (in seconds): <input type="text" id="in" size="10" value="" /><input type="button" value="Calculate!" onclick="document.getElementById('out').value = document.getElementById('in').value * document.getElementById('in').value * 4.903325;" />

Height of building (in metres): <input type="text" id="out" size="10" value="" style="border-width: 0px;" />
